Clustering:
🛍️ Customer Segmentation Project
This repository contains an unsupervised machine learning analysis focused on Customer Segmentation using the provided Train_cluster.csv dataset.

🎯 Project Goal
To group customers into distinct segments using clustering algorithms to inform targeted marketing strategies. The analysis aims to find natural groupings and potentially validate them against the existing Segmentation column in the dataset.

📂 Dataset: Train_cluster.csv
Records: 8,068

Features: 11 (including Gender, Age, Profession, Spending_Score, and Segmentation).
Key Challenge: The dataset contains missing values across several features (e.g., Work_Experience, Family_Size), requiring careful imputation during preprocessing.

🛠️ Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values (imputation) and converted categorical features into numerical formats (One-Hot Encoding).
Feature Scaling: Used StandardScaler to normalize numerical features.

Clustering Algorithms:
K-Means: Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters (k).
Hierarchical Clustering: Used a Dendrogram to visualize the optimal linkage and number of clusters.
Evaluation: Clusters were profiled and compared against the existing Segmentation column to assess alignment.

provided a test dataset as well


Regression:

🏠 House Price Prediction (Regression)
This repository details a regression analysis project aimed at predicting residential housing sale prices using a comprehensive dataset of home features.

🎯 Project Goal
To build and compare the performance of several predictive models in estimating the SalePrice of homes based on their characteristics (e.g., location, quality, area, year built).

📂 Dataset: train.csv
Records: 1,460

Features: 81 attributes, including numerical features (GrLivArea, YearBuilt) and many categorical features (MSZoning, Neighborhood).
Key Challenge: The dataset features numerous missing values across many columns (e.g., LotFrontage, FireplaceQu, PoolQC), requiring extensive preprocessing.

🧠 Models Used
The following regression models were trained and evaluated:

Multilinear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor (Ensemble Method)

🛠️ Methodology Highlights
Feature Engineering & Preprocessing: Handled missing data (Imputation) and converted categorical features into a numerical format suitable for modeling.

Model Training & Evaluation: Models were trained on the processed data and evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R 
2
  Score.
Best Model: [INSERT BEST PERFORMING MODEL HERE e.g., Random Forest] achieved the lowest RMSE/highest R 
2
 .
